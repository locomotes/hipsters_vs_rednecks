2. Create a turn based game

Add a Player Constructor that allows me to create different players with different skill levels and maybe even multiple attack methods. You could potentially even create a second constructor if the properties were very different.
Add an Enemy Constructor that allows you to create multiple enemies 
Set up interactions between your enemy and your player.
Each player/enemy should start out with some type of "health" value and it will decrease with each attack.
The game will alternate between a player and an enemy attacking (or maybe the player gets 2 hits then the enemy etc, but make it have some back and fourth)
Once a bad guy is dead, visually show this
Once your player is dead (health <= 0) show a game over message (or picture...)
Try to add different attack methods, kick, punch, special etc
Use some random values so each experience is different
Make it pretty!! Not looking for a masterpiece but add some flair!
